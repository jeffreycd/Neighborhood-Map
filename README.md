# Neighborhood Map Project
## Introduction
This is one of the projects for the Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree
program.
The project is a single page web application that displays a map and several
restaurants in New Orleans, LA.

## About
The application will display a collapsible side menu that lists each of the
restaurants displayed on the map. Clicking a list item will select that venue. The
corresponding marker on the map will change color and display an information
window. Clicking a marker on the map will have the same result.
The list of restaurants can be filtered using the text input at the top of the
side menu.
The list of restaurants is provided by Foursquare's API. The map is provided by
Google Maps API.
